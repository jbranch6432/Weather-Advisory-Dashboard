# Weather-Advisory-Dashboard


## Description

As a developer student, I want to create a weather application that will display the current weather for a city the user searched for and the five day forecast for that same city. I also want to be able to store the search history of cities previously searched in local storage so they can be retrieved again.

## Usage

The search bar allows users to search for a city. When the search button is clicked the weather data for that city will populate to the application page. A new button will also be created with that city name so the user can click on that button and pull the current weather data again for that particular city.
